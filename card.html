            <h2>Difference between var, let and const keywords</h2>
            <div>
                <h3>var</h3>

                <p>The variable ‘a’ is declared inside the function. If the user tries to access it outside the
                    function, it will display the error. Users can declare the 2 variables with the same name using the
                    var keyword. Also, the user can reassign the value into the var variable. The output shown in the
                    console.</p>

                <h3> let can be updated but not re-declared.</h3>

                <p>Just like var, a variable declared with let can be updated within its scope. Unlike var, a let
                    variable cannot be re-declared within its scope. So while this will work:</p>

                <h3>
                    const cannot be updated or re-declared,,,,,
                </h3>
                <p>const declarations are block scoped
                    Like let declarations, const declarations can only be accessed within the block they were declared.
                </p>

                <p>const cannot be updated or re-declared
                    This means that the value of a variable declared with const remains the same within its scope. It
                    cannot be updated or re-declared. So if we declare a variable with const, we can neither do this:
                </p>
                <p>This will update the value of greeting.message without returning errors.</p>

            <!-- why use templete string? -->
            <h2>why use templete string?</h2>

            <div>You can use template strings to write your string exactly how you want it to appear, without all the
                quotation marks and confusion. Template strings make it very easy to spot a missing space and make your
                string more readable</div>

            <!-- difference between regular and arrow function -->
            <h2>difference between regular and arrow function</h2>
            <div>Regular functions created using function declarations or expressions are constructible and callable.
                Since regular functions are constructible, they can be called using the new keyword. However, the arrow
                functions are only callable and not constructible, i.e arrow functions can never be used as constructor
                functions.</div>
